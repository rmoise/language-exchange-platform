**CREATE DESIGN SYSTEM JSON**
TO ANALYZE: $ARGUMENTS
**GOAL**
Your goal is to extract a generalized and reusable design system from the screenshots provided in `$ARGUMENTS`, **without including specific image content**, so that frontend developers or Al agents can reference the JSON as a style foundation for building consistent UIs.
**Task**
1. Analyze the screenshots provided in `$ARGUMENTS` to infer:
   
* Color palette
* Typography rules
* Spacing guidelines
* Layout structure (grids, cards, containers, etc.)
* UI components (buttons, inputs, tables, etc.)
* Border radius, shadows, and other visual styling pattern

2. Create a `design-system.json` file that clearly defines these rules and can be used to replicate the visual language in a consistent way.
3. Output the JSON to the `prd` folder with the name: `design-system.json`

**Constraints**

* Do **not** extract specific content from the screenshots (no text, logos,
icons) .
* Focus purely on *design principles*, *structure*, and *styles*.
